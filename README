ColorPicker V1.0

ColorPicker V1.0 is a powerful color picker for all iOS devices. 
It supports RGB/HSV and CMYK color schemes and the alpha channel as well.
CMYK is only supported on the iPad view, because the iPhone display ist definitly too small for it.

To show how it works, I put the ColorPicker in a very simple view based applikation, which can be build and run directly for testing.

This code is free to use, but I recommend, that you to write me an email with the name of the App in which you implemented my Colorpicker, when the App is available for download. Thanks for that.

Have fun with this piece of code
